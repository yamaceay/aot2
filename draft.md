`AuctioneerAgent.kt`

Phases:
* REGISTERING: Agents register, registerPhase()
    * Broadcast all bidders with a register message, including the logistics of the auction
* STARTING: After registration, startPhase()
    * Assign bidders 500 credits worth of items of random types
    * Broadcast a registered message with the initial items and credits
* BIDDING: Agents bid on items, biddingPhase()
    * Get all already advertised offers where bid-lists exist
    * Sort the bids in descending order
    * Determine the final price
    * Send messages to both seller and buyer (if any)
    * Advertise any new Offers to the bidder agents
* EVALUATING: Auctioneer evaluates all bids, evaluationPhase()
    * Sort all offers by bid
    * Send the AuctionResults to all bidders, keeping this order
* END: End of Auction, -

* Act 
    * On CashIn messages:
        * Check if a cash-in is valid
        * Update the bidder's wallet
        * Send a CashInResult message to the bidder
    * On Offer messages:
        * Check if an offer is valid
        * Calculate how much the bidder is already expected to payÂ (pending)
        * If the bid and pending amount is less than the bidder's credits, save the offer 

Attributes:
* Secrets: Random secret numbers used for each bidder for very simple authentication in both sides
* Wallets: For keeping track of bidder agents' wallets (they should do the same)
* Pools: Current "pools" of items to change their owner, grouped by item type

`DummyBidderAgent.kt`

```yaml
DummyBidderAgent:
- broker: BrokerAgentRef
- wallet: Wallet?
- secret: Int

Receives:
# - [DONE] StartAuction from topic "all-bidders"
# - [EASY] Registered
- LookingFor from topic "all-bidders"
- OfferResult
- Digest from topic "all-bidders"
# - [EASY] AuctionResult

Sends:
# - [DONE] Register
- LookingFor to topic "all-bidders"
- Offer
# - [EASY] CashIn
```

Each agent uses the following information sources when bidding:
* `Number of Agents`
* `Wallet` is an attribute: For keeping track of the agent's credits and goods
* `LookingFor` is a type of message: For seeing the preferences of others
* `Digest` is a type of message: For seeing the statistical results of the last turn

    # Question: Can agent use fibsum() to calculate its preferences in a way that is not obvious to the auctioneer?

    # Game Theory Perspective
    # -----------------------
    # Let X be a list of all goods in the current auction
    # Let A be a set of agents who are bidding
    # If A_1 wants to buy X, it should bid higher than the median price of X
    # If A_1 bids too high, it will increase the median price of X, and let agent A_1 pay more than it should
    # If A_1 bids too low, it will be outbid by the agent in the middle, and it will lose the opportunity to buy X
    # Vice versa goes for selling

    # If A_1 does not care about others' preferences, it follows a incentive compatible strategy (anreizkompatibel)
    # -> A_1 only uses its private preferences when bidding


# Estimate the private preferences by differentiating the new wallet with one more good for a specific type and the old wallet
def calculate_private_preferences(wallet: Wallet) -> dict[Good, Credit]:
    private_preferences = {}
    goods, credits = wallet
    for good, count in goods.items():
        old_value = value(wallet)

        # Generate a new copy of wallet with one more good of given type
        goods_copy = goods.copy()
        goods_copy[good] = count + 1
        wallet_copy = (goods_copy, credits)

        # Save the preference value
        preference = value(wallet_copy) - old_value
        private_preferences[good] = preference

    # Sort the private preferences in descending order
    private_preferences = sorted(private_preferences, key=lambda x: private_preferences[x], reverse=True)
