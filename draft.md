```yaml
DummyBidderAgent:
- broker: BrokerAgentRef
- wallet: Wallet?
- secret: Int

Receives:
# - [DONE] StartAuction from topic "all-bidders"
# - [EASY] Registered
- LookingFor from topic "all-bidders"
- OfferResult
- Digest from topic "all-bidders"
# - [EASY] AuctionResult

Sends:
# - [DONE] Register
- LookingFor to topic "all-bidders"
- Offer
# - [EASY] CashIn
```

Each agent uses the following information sources when bidding:
* `Number of Agents`
* `Wallet` is an attribute: For keeping track of the agent's credits and goods
* `LookingFor` is a type of message: For seeing the preferences of others
* `Digest` is a type of message: For seeing the statistical results of the last turn

```python

Stats = tuple[
    int, # number of offers
    Price, # min price
    Price, # median price
    Price, # max price
    ]

Agent = str
Good = str
GoodOrCredit = str

Amount = float
Price = float
PriceCount = tuple[Price, int]

Wallet = dict[GoodOrCredit, Amount]
# - update()
# - value()

Digest = dict[Good, Stats]
Offer = dict[Good, PriceCount]
