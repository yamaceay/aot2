`AuctioneerAgent.kt`

Phases:
* REGISTERING: Agents register, registerPhase()
    * Broadcast all bidders with a register message, including the logistics of the auction
* STARTING: After registration, startPhase()
    * Assign bidders 500 credits worth of items of random types
    * Broadcast a registered message with the initial items and credits
* BIDDING: Agents bid on items, biddingPhase()
    * Get all already advertised offers where bid-lists exist
    * Sort the bids in descending order
    * Determine the final price
    * Send messages to both seller and buyer (if any)
    * Advertise any new Offers to the bidder agents
* EVALUATING: Auctioneer evaluates all bids, evaluationPhase()
    * Sort all offers by bid
    * Send the AuctionResults to all bidders, keeping this order
* END: End of Auction, -

* Act 
    * On CashIn messages:
        * Check if a cash-in is valid
        * Update the bidder's wallet
        * Send a CashInResult message to the bidder
    * On Offer messages:
        * Check if an offer is valid
        * Calculate how much the bidder is already expected to payÂ (pending)
        * If the bid and pending amount is less than the bidder's credits, save the offer 

Attributes:
* Secrets: Random secret numbers used for each bidder for very simple authentication in both sides
* Wallets: For keeping track of bidder agents' wallets (they should do the same)
* Pools: Current "pools" of items to change their owner, grouped by item type

### Implementation of Bidding Strategies of Agents

_For an intuitive explanation, refer to `biddingStrategies.md`._

Each agent uses the following information sources when bidding:
* `Number of Agents`
* `Wallet` is an attribute: For keeping track of the agent's credits and goods
* `Digest` is a type of message: For seeing the statistical results of the last turn / and also market place prices
* `LookingFor` is a type of message: For seeing the preferences of others

```python

Agent = str
Good = str
GoodCount = tuple[Good, int]
Inventory = dict[Good, int]

Credit = float 

Stats = tuple[
    int, # number of offers
    Credit, # min price
    Credit, # median price
    Credit, # max price
    ]

Wallet = tuple[Inventory, Credit]
# - update(self, Good, int, Credit)
# - value(self) -> Credit

Offer = dict[Good, Credit]
Digest = dict[Good, Stats]

# Ensure that good type does not matter, except that each good is superadditive, this means: u(av + bv) >= u(av) + u(bv) for any v and any good type

# any_agent_plays_strategically: If True, then the agent will try to play strategically, otherwise it will play honestly
